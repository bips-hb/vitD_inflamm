This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of from the paper "Longitudinal associations between vitamin D status and biomarkers of inflammation in a pan-European cohort of children and adolescents" by Wolters et al.

The analysis was performed on the central data server of the IDEFICS/I.Family Study using STATA. In order to reproduce the results as presented in the paper, run the `VitD_inflamm_siunit.do` script.

### Data Availabilty
Due to the sensitive nature of data collected from children and adolescents, ethical restrictions prohibit the authors from making the minimal data set publicly available. Each cohort center received approval of the corresponding local Ethical Commission. Data are available on request and all requests need approval by the study’s Steering Committee. Interested researchers can contact the study coordinator (i.family@leibnizbips.de) to request data access. All requests for accessing data of the IDEFIES/I.Family cohort are discussed on a case-by-case basis by the Steering Committee.

### Acknowledgement
The authors wish to thank the IDEFICS/I.Family children and their parents for participating in the extensive examinations. Additionally, the authors are grateful to the valuable support of school boards, head teachers and communities.

### Funding
Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL. This work was supported by the European Union within the Sixth RTD Framework Programme [Contract No. 016181 (FOOD)] for the IDEFICS study and within the Seventh RTD Framework Programme [Contract No. 266044] for the I.Family study.
